It will enable students of this course to see how some of the basic concepts in biochemistry (specifically those learned in BIOC1600 and BIOC2600) could be applied to explain one of the most important and cardinal issues of biological life: the acquisition of metabolic energy. The course will lay the foundation for the more advanced courses offered in the Biochemistry Major and will also serve as a useful complement to courses on nutrition and dietetics.,"This course focuses on the central metabolic pathways involved in the provision of energy needed by living organisms. Major metabolic pathways covered in this course include those that are involved in the synthesis and breakdown of glucose, glycogen, triacylglycerol, and amino acids.  The metabolism of purines and pyrimidines will also be considered. Emphasis is on the understanding of the metabolic reactions involved and how they are regulated in relation to environmental cues. Metabolic derangements as a basis of diseases will also be discussed.",achieve a vigorous intellectual appreciation of basic principles of functional organization of metabolic networks; identify one's own gaps of basic knowledge in metabolism and to fill up those gaps from literature resources through effective means or approaches; develop the communication and social skills essential for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge,Pass in BIOC2600 or BIOL2220 or MEDE2301 or BMED2301,2022 Major in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Core/Compulsory                                                        ); 2022 Minor in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Major in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Core/Compulsory                                                        ); 2021 Minor in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Major in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Core/Compulsory                                                        ); 2020 Minor in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Major in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Core/Compulsory                                                        ); 2019 Minor in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Major in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Core/Compulsory                                                        ); 2018 Minor in Biochemistry                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ),"2022 Major in Biochemistry < PLO 1,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2021 Major in Biochemistry < PLO 1,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2020 Major in Biochemistry < PLO 1,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2019 Major in Biochemistry < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2018 Major in Biochemistry < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >","Y                         1st sem",Y,A+ to F,A    Demonstrates thorough and extensive knowledge and skills required for attaining all the course learning outcomes.

The course is divided into 4 parts and the following is a list of some of the questions to be asked and discussed:Genes and inheritance: How do children resemble their parents? What is the central dogma of biology? What are the rules of genetic inheritance? What determines gender and sexuality? Why is that children resemble, but not identical to, their parents? What happen if some genes are non-functional or mutated? Metabolism and Health: How are diets related to good health? Do all humans have the same dietary requirements? Why can't we live without plants?Cells and cell division: What are the common features in a cell? How do cells communicate and assemble themselves to form tissues and organs? What is a cell cycle and how it is regulated? What happens if cell-cycle control system goes wrong? How newly formed cells commit themselves for differentiation? Genetic engineering and modern biology: To what extent can genes be modified? Is gene therapy the future of medicines? Is genetically modified food safe for consumption? What are the Genome Projects and why have they been important?",understand the relationships between genes in a genome and the inherited phenotypes expressed in a living organism; learn the underlying principle on how mutation of a gene can lead to the development of a genetic disease; understand the importance of dietary intake of biomolecules in relationship to good health; describe various stages in a cell division and that disturbance of this process may result in cancer development; describe concepts used in genetic engineering; know some applications of genetic engineering in gene therapy and production of genetically modified food,"Not for students who have passed in BIOC1600, or have already enrolled in this course.; Students who wish to take this course are expected to have

The course also demonstrates how we can understand and explain the significance of what we see in nature using scientific methods.  A field course component provides the opportunity to investigate how the environment influences community composition, biodiversity and adaptive radiation in a variety of habitats.","The environment influences organisms profoundly. It affects their present-day ecology (determining where they live and how many can survive there) and, through natural selection acting over past generations, influences their form and adaptations. Present day human-induced changes to the environment are also responsible for endangering species and degrading their habitats. This introductory course introduces some basic scientific principles of ecology and evolution, showing how they are linked to the environment by physiological tolerances and evolutionary adaptation which, in turn, lead to specialization and generate biodiversity. Individuals and their interactions will be a major focus of the course together with discussion of population dynamics, community structuring, life histories, and niche dynamics. The principles of ecology and evolution resulting from interaction with the environment will also be demonstrated by describing the origins of modern humans, including our fossil record and relationship to other primates, and the main ecological transformations caused by humans and their environmental impacts. The course will conclude with an account of the importance of biodiversity, and the factors that threaten it globally. Lectures are complemented by a 5-day field course during the Reading Week when students visit a variety of Hong Kong habitats to study their biodiversity, community composition and the relationship between organisms and their environment","understand how scientific methods (hypotheses, experiments, comparisons) are used to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes; understand the basic mechanism of natural selection, and how interactions with the environment lead to adaptation and generate biodiversity; understand that ecology and behaviour can be interpreted in the light of selective pressures from the environment upon individual organisms; understand the ecological factors influencing evolution, using the human evolutionary tree as an example; understand the community ecology and biodiversity of selected Hong Kong habitats, and typical adaptations of organisms found there",Pass in BIOL1110 or BIOL1309 or ENVS1301 or ENVS1401,2022 Major in Biological Sciences

The course will teach students the underlying mechanism and function of behaviour, and how did a particular behaviour develop and evolve.","Why do animal behaviours vary among individuals and species? How do environment and ecological interactions influence behaviours? What are the underlying genetic mechanism of a particular behaviour? In this course, students will learn to think within the ecological and evolutionary perspectives on animal behaviour. Topics include behavioral ecology; behavioral genetics; reproductive behaviour; mating system; parental care; communication; foraging; learning; migration and biological rhythms; evolutionary stable strategies; sexual selection; altruism; and sociality in vertebrates and invertebrates. We will discuss several classical studies that form the foundation of this field, as well as more recent research that have led to current understanding of animal behaviour. This course will give students a unique perspective on the natural world and our own species.","learn and appreciate the mechanism, function, development, and evolution of animal behaviour; understand the complexity of interactions between natural and sexual selection and animal behaviour; appreciate current theories that form basis for modern understanding of animal behaviour; learn the scientific reasoning and methodology in the field of Animal Behaviour; think analytically, based upon ecological and evolutionary principles, to explain the behaviours observed in the natural world and our own specie",Pass in BIOL2306,2022 Major in Biological Sciences (Intensive)                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        );

The food-environment-health nexus (FEHN) interrelates the agri-food system (AFS) and community health. Students will learn the agri-food system which is categorized into crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture that focus on resource shortage and degradation, climate change, disease, exacerbating resource pressures and human suffering. The impact of current agricultural technology on plant health and animal feeds, sustainable and alternative food production, environment on food systems will also be explored. Notwithstanding xenobiotic effect on animal and human health, environmental influence on sensory decision, the aftermath of climate change and nutritional security of a community will be discussed.

Our ultimate aim is to promote an understanding of the natural biodiversity, the threats to it, and the best ways to manage them. We hope these will be your aims too, and that you will be able to use the skills and knowledge you learn from the course to reduce the local, regional and global loss of biodiversity.","Among the many environmental issues, the most serious is the increasingly rapid loss of biodiversity. This loss is irreversible on a human timescale and will reduce the options available to all future human generations. Conservation Biology/Ecology is the science of preserving biological diversity. This course also provides insights to the many benefits and services that nature offers and explores strategies for management options to sustain ecological integrity and production. It is an inexact, applied, mission-orientated, multidisciplinary science which, like medicine, has built-in values: to a conservation biologist, as to a doctor, it matters whether the patient lives or dies. It is also a very new science, bringing together elements from ecology, environmental science, forestry, resource management and many other fields.The course is designed to provide the knowledge, theories, and research related to biodiversity conservation. Our teaching focuses on biodiversity conservation, conservation issues associated with climate change, the key theoretical underpinning of biodiversity conservation and an introduction to conservation legislation and economics. We emphasis on the integration of knowledge, skills and abilities that are required to practice conservation. Our problem based learning approach will require students to actively participate in their group project/class room debate by researching.","develop a framework for critical thinking about biodiversity, environment and human interaction; understand why species are becoming extinct and predict which ones will be most vulnerable; understand the importance of the threat of tropical deforestation, marine and coastal degradation, and habitat fragmentation in species extinction, and explain the main forces behind habitat and biodiversity loss; understand the principles of population viability analysis, the basis of single-species conservation management and the role of ex situ conservation, ecological restoration and reintroduction in conservation; outline the legal and administrative basis for conservation in Hong Kong and the world; appreciate the roles and relationships of economic, social and environmental sciences in the conservation of biodiversity",Pass in

waves; geological and hydrological processes) the resultant variations in exposure and shore types and consequent distribution of animals and algae on these shores (vertical and horizontal zonation patterns) with specific Hong Kong examples.  The second part of the course uses an experimental approach (e.g. sampling methodology; manipulative techniques; experimental design and data analysis) to investigate the factors (e.g. predation; herbivory; competition; disturbance; succession; patchiness and recruitment; supply side ecology) that structure these shores, with particular focus on rocky intertidal shores.","describe the physical environmental factors (e.g., waves, tides) shaping the intertidal environment and how they interact with geographic features to produce different kinds of shores (e.g., sandy shores, mangroves); understand the factors limiting species distribution patterns on the vertical intertidal gradient and appreciate methods to measure and investigate these patterns; identify and quantify the distribution of a variety of local species on different Hong Kong shores;

Students will learn about the evolution of climate and topography over geological times and their roles in shaping current biodiversity and ecosystems distribution. The course also focuses on the taxonomic, functional and ecological composition of organisms within terrestrial ecosystems of Tropical East Asia with emphasis on the major processes regulating communities. An introduction to several global major threats on terrestrial ecosystems and their mechanisms is provided. Finally, the study of habitats recovery through ecological succession using particular examples in Hong Kong is provided. The practical component of the course will introduce students to basic field techniques used in ecology. Students will participate to a group project, collecting and analysing their own data involving both field and laboratory work, and write a short scientific paper. Particular emphasis will be given on how to efficiently read and write scientific literature and present data efficiently. Attendance and participation in class are encouraged through series of discussions to stimulate critical thinking on chosen topics in terrestrial ecology. Assessment includes problem-based learning exercise, group presentation, a final term paper and a final examination covering the content of the course.",understand evolution of biodiversity patterns

Williams,School of Biological sciences)","Using a comparative approach between Hong Kong and South African shores, students will learn to identify the relevant environmental gradients which define the intertidal zone, and the species interactions which mould these communities.   This will be achieved through an intensive field-based approach, visiting and working in different intertidal habitats in both Hong Kong and, during a residential fieldcamp, in South Africa.","Students will learn the abiotic and biotic factors that structure intertidal communities in Hong Kong and, during a residential fieldcamp, different South African intertidal communities.  In South Africa, specific topics will focus on(1) Intertidal biodiversity and species interactions(2) Species distribution patterns on intertidal shores(3) Species interactions and behaviour (4) Trophic interactions and connectivity between local terrestrial and marine communities.(5) Larger-scale connectivity from freshwaters to marine systemsHKU Students will work in groups with students from the University of Johannesburg and North West University, South Africa to collect data; design and carry out experiments; present their findings; and write up formal scientific reports on the different topics.Note individual topics may change in different years and are weather dependent.","compare the contrast the shallow water coastal environments of Hong Kong and the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa; identify a range of species and their roles and relationships in the intertidal zone; understand the abiotic conditions defining the intertidal environment and quantify and interpret the distribution of species over relevant environmental gradients; design, execute and analyse experiments to investigate species interactions; integrate abiotic and biotic interactions to determine patterns of connectivity between intertidal habitats; analyse, interpret and present data using a variety of media to demonstrate scientific understanding of topics",Pass in BIOL2306 or BIOL3301,2022 Major in Ecology & Biodiversity                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        );

Genome-wide profiling of various biomolecules simultaneously by omics technology generates huge amounts of data, providing the potential to obtain a global and holistic view of the system. This course aims to introduce the technologies of Omics and Systems Biology, and overview of various applications of omics technology.Synthetic biology is set to be the heart of future economy, promising to create new drugs, industrial materials and energy sources similar to chemical synthesis. The significance of this field has been promoted by the worldwide synthetic biology competition organized by MIT, i.e., iGEM competition. In this course, we will introduce some innovative ideas in synthetic biology and practice the skills needed for iGEM competition.","The course covers various OMICS techniques with special focus on sequence alignment, next generation sequencing, computational modeling, and statistic programming. This course will also provide students hands-on experience in large scale data analysis, and experiment methodologies involved in:Systems biology and functional genomics - the study of the interactome/network between components of a biological system, and modeling to discover the integrated function and emergent properties of that system;Synthetic biology- the design and building of synthetic protocells using basic biochemical building blocks from scratch.","explain the conceptual differences between 'Omics'/Systems Biology studies and traditional one-gene approach, and discuss the pros and cons of both approaches; describe common methodologies used in iGEM and Synthetic biology; describe basic analytical methods, and access database resources generated in major 'Omics'

This is an interdisciplinary endeavor encompassing larval hatchery technology, seafood quality, and economic dimensions of coastal aquaculture business. After reading about basic oyster biology and oyster aquaculture topics, we will focus on how marine larvae will be useful for human society through hatchery technology and aquaculture business. Environmental issues, legislation pertaining to coastal aquaculture business and community interaction will also be covered using oyster aquaculture in Hong Kong as an example. Students will be exposed to several aquaculture facilities in Hong Kong, Zhanjiang, and Qingdao to learn industrial and business skills of oyster aquaculture. This course is designed to meet the needs of an expanding sustainable aquaculture in Hong Kong and in mainland. Career and small scale business opportunities in aquaculture industry will be discussed.","gain scientific knowledge required for setting up oyster hatchery, farming and small-scale business, beside understanding biology and ecology of larvae and shellfishes and consider potential environmental effects on hatchery and farming;

Here you will learn about the various biological/ecological principles and concepts of environmental science which are needed for critical discussion and evaluation of current global environmental issues including human ecology, urbanization, ecological economics, and climate change.","This course is a combination of lectures, group discussion/debate and field trips cum tutorials. We first explore the fundamental interactions between organisms and their environment. We then explore environmental constraints on life at various ecosystems (like marine, freshwater, and terrestrial). Students will also learn how factors such as urbanization, climate change, and anthropogenic impacts affect life at population and ecosystem levels.   Similarly, students will be exposed to the incredible interrelationships that are basic to ecological principles and the impact that human development has upon these interrelationships. After learning basics of environmental life science, students will be stimulated to think about current life science issues such as biodiversity loss, organisms adaptation to climate change, tragedy of commons (human ecology) and applied life science topics such as biomaterial science.","understand life, environment and their interactions;

This course will explore the contributions that human population growth and globalization have made to increases in greenhouse gases and associated climate change, biological invasions, land degradation, disease, and, ultimately, impacts on biological systems.","Environmental change is a natural phenomenon, with ecosystems continually shifting, rearranging, emerging, and disappearing through geologic time with changes in climatic conditions. The activities of humans have added to this natural variation, increasing the magnitude and speed with which environmental change occurs. This course will focus principally on the effects of climate change on organisms and ecosystems but will also investigate other topics registering on a global scale including land use change, biological invasions, and pollution, as well as synergistic interactions between all of the environmental stressors. We will explore (1) what climate change is and how it is manifested including climate warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification; (2) types and extents of land use change; (3) how globalization has contributed to the spread of alien species and disease. The course will investigate how these human-caused stressors affect the morphology, phenology, distribution, and evolution of organisms and their impacts on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems.","develop a basic understanding of climate change and other human-associated impacts, such as land use change, and how they are manifested on a global scale; explain the ways that global change affects organisms' traits and distributions, and biodiversity at the ecosystem level; understand the differences between climate change on a geologic time scale and recent climate change;

This program will explore the mechanisms by which coastal communities in the US and SE Asia are facing these expanding challenges, including their impacts on coastal ecosystems. Using a comparative approach, students will explore the diverse challenges facing coastal societies, and will gain an in-depth understanding of coupled human-natural systems on the coasts of New England and Southeast Asia (Hong Kong and Malaysia).By comparing and contrasting both ecosystems and societies, students will develop an appreciation for both the commonalities of challenges facing the world's coasts, as well as differences that occur due to local ecology. A major emphasis of the program will be on solutions, and how by taking a global perspective we can accelerate methods for climate change adaptation that span traditional cultural barriers. We will blend studies of threats facing both human and natural systems in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Gulf of Maine with an in-depth exploration of how those societies have (or have not) enacted solutions to those challenges.","Articulating similarities and differences between how coupled human-natural systems operate in SE Asia and in comparable habitats in the U.S.A.; Reading and synthesizing review articles in the primary literature in marine science and social science literature, and explain the connections among these diverse approaches; Articulating arguments about how traditional Chinese, Malaysian and American culture affect human impacts on the environment, and to develop potential solutions to these issues based on conversations with peers; Becoming comfortable collaborating with peers from U.S.A, and gain a greater understanding of the culture of the region",Pass in BIOL2306 or BIOL3301 or BIOL3305 or BIOL3318 or ENVS2001 or ENVS2002 or EASC3020,2022 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ),"2022 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                          2021 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                          2020 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                          2019 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                          2018 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >","Y                                     Summer",Y,A+ to F,"A    Demonstrate thorough mastery at an advanced level of extensive knowledge and skills required for attaining all the course learning outcomes.

Through field studies in both degraded and prisitine habitats, students will gain an understanding of the major drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss in a tropical landscape in Sabah, Borneo and learn about measures to mitigate the impacts of human activities in these vital ecosystems. Students will work in groups to develop and carry out a research project to address ecological or environmental questions. After the field portion of the course, students will write up the results of their projects in the style of a scientific paper.","Tropical rainforests are the most biologically rich terrestrial ecosystems, providing important environmental services such as nutrient cycling, carbon storage and new medicines. Rainforests are under increasing anthropogenic pressure due to logging, burning and conversion to agriculture, as well as climate change. Effective conservation efforts over the next few decades are essential if we are to slow down our impacts on these vital ecosystems. In this course, through a series of lectures, tutorials and fieldwork, students will learn about tropical rainforest ecosystems, investigate the environmental impacts of land use change, and discuss conservation measures which can help mitigate these impacts. Students will also learn techniques for designing and carrying out field research projects, and about the importance of data generated from research to inform efforts to minimize the impact of human activities in such important ecosystems. The bulk of the course will be carried out in Danum Valley, a primary tropical rainforest located in Sabah, Malaysia. We will visit some sites impacted by human activities, including palm oil plantations, to observe how land-use changes impact biodiversity and observe in situ conservation efforts. Students will work in groups to conduct research projects which will tie together the concepts learned through the lectures and field trips",demonstrate an understanding of the importance of ecological and natural history knowledge for conservation; understand the major impacts of human activity on tropical rainforest ecosystems; work collaboratively to design and carry out a research project (collect and analyze data and present results) on an ecological or environmental topic; carry out a range of field sampling and observational techniques for collecting data in the field,Pass in ENVS2001 or ENVS2002 or BIOL2306,2022 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2022 Minor in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Minor in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Minor in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Minor in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Major in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Minor in Environmental Science                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ),"2022 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2021 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2020 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2019 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 2 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2018 Major in Environmental Science < PLO 1,2,3,4 >","Y                                     Summer",Y,A+ to F,"A    Demonstrate an advanced level of extensive knowledge and skills required for attaining all the course learning outcomes.

In addition, students should become familiar with the way the study of Earth Sciences blends observation, information, hypothesis, communication and decision making for a better understanding of the future of our planet.","This introductory course will introduce and discuss the following topics : - Introduction to Earth Systems and Habitable Planet Earth, - Lithosphere (Earth Materials, Plate Tectonics, Volcanism, Earthquakes, Surface Processes and Rock Cycle)- Hydrosphere (Surface- and Groundwater, Oceans and Water Cycle)- Atmosphere (Composition, Weather, Climate, Green House Effect, Oxygen Cycle)- Biosphere (Life, Ecosystems, Evolution and Extinction, Geochemical Cycles, - Concepts and Evolution of Dynamic Earth Systems, Human Interactions with Planet Earth (Earth Resources, Geological Hazards, Climate Change, Human Impact and Environmental Changes)",understand the terminology and nomenclature appropriate to the introductory study of Earth Sciences; demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the underlying concepts associated with the study of the Earth Systems and their dynamic interactive processes; understand the extent and nature of global change and environmental concerns around us; demonstrate the ability to make and record observations on Earth Systems processes in natural field environments; develop skills to synthesize observation and knowledge in a report

Likely case studies include exploration of various climate-tectonic interactions across mountain belts (Andes, Himalaya), the complex intraplate deformation of East Asia, and the progressive development of metamorphic core complexes via low-angle normal faults (N. America, NE China).

The course requires integration of geological knowledge from multiple geological disciplines.,"Students will visit areas of geological interest and will undertake independent and group mapping and problem solving exercises in each area. The curriculum comprised 3 x 6-day long projects (based on an ~2x5km area of interest),where each week long project is typically scheduled as follows:Day 1-2: Instructor-lead learning. Day 3-5: Technique application/independent field mapping and site visit.Day 6: Field examination.Day 7: Write up/Rest.  For each project area students is required to produce:A detailed geologic map of the area. (15% x 3 = 45%)A cross-section of the area. (5% x 3 = 15%)To accompany these maps, the students must prepare ONE report (15%) - This field report should include the tectonic evolution of region, synthesized from the all three projects and site visits, complete with interpretations of depositional environments, magmatic events and structural data.To assess  field skills:3 one-day field exam, where students, working INDEPENDENTLY of other students and faculty, construct a geologic map and cross sections in a small (~1km x ~1km) area that they have not previously visited. (5% for each one-day field exam)10% will be awarded for professional conduct.","Describe the petrography and petrogenesis of rocks and minerals.; Identify geological setting from lithologies and stratigraphy.; Measure, record and analyse structural data.; Construct geological maps and cross-sections.; Synthesize varied geological information pertaining to an area in order to derive a basic model of tectonic evolution.;

The oceans take up 71% of earth's surface and contain 98% of the water.  By looking at the structure of the atmosphere, thermodynamic principals and properties governing sea water, we will evaluate the critical roles the ocean plays in the environmental system including its influence on (paleo)climate, coastal resources, and nutrient cycling.  Case studies specifically examining changes in sea level rise, El Nino, and (paleo)climate will be used to connect oceanographic principles to environmental problems.","describe the major surface and deep currents of the ocean;

Important applications of number theory to modern cryptography will also be introduced.","-The course will begin with some basic notions in number theory, including divisibility, greatest common divisor, Euclidean algorithm, congruences, etc. It will then be followed by several fundamental theorems, such as Chinese remainder theorem, solutions of linear and polynomial congruences, Fermat's Little theorem, and the quadratic reciprocity law. - Many well-known open problems will be introduced. Application of number theory to public key cryptography will be explained. Some current research on the prime numbers will be discussed. - Depending on the time available, the course will cover a selection of further topics, such as the prime number theorem, sum of squares, Dirichlet's theorem on diophantine approximations, continued fractions, etc.",solve a system of linear congruences; solve polynomial congruences; determine the solubility of quadratic congruences by computation of the Legendre symbol; determine the existence of primitive roots and use them in solving some exponential congruences; understand the prime number theorem; understanding some longstanding problems in number theory,Pass in MATH2101 and MATH2211.

use the celestial sphere model to describe the apparent trajectories of celestial objects; review the evolution of the world-view from the geocentric model to the heliocentric model and the discovery of the expansion of the universe on our world-view; apply quantitative physical laws, including Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, Newton's law of universal gravitation, Doppler shift formula and Hubble's law to calculate and solve simple astronomical problems; explain the evolution of stars and the evolution of the universe; communicate astronomical problems and solutions using appropriate astronomical terminology and good English",NIL,2022 Major in Physics (Intensive)                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        );

Instead of the cookbook approach, we focus on training students how to think and work as physicists through tackling simple physics problems by both analytical and numerical means. After completion, interested students may take the other second level courses in this series PHYS2155 and/or PHYS2160 or the third level course in this series PHYS3150.","This course introduces the principles and theories of various mathematical methods and skills that are essential for studying university physics. Topics include: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, three-dimensional coordinate geometry, partial differentiation, multiple integration, vector functions and motion in space, and vector analysis. Applications to physical systems and various practical problems solving skills are discussed. Further MATLAB commands and basic MATLAB programming will be introduced and used in this course.",review the theory and principles of mathematical methods and compare the features of various methods;

Instead of the cookbook approach, we focus on training students how to think and work as physicists through tackling simple physics problems by both analytical and numerical means. After completion, interested students may take the other second level courses in this series PHYS2150 and/or PHYS2160 or the third level course in this series PHYS3150.","This course introduces the principles and theories of various mathematical methods and skills that are essential for studying university physics. Topics include: matrices and vector spaces, systems of linear algebraic equations and systems of linear differential equations, Line integrals, surface integrals and volume integrals, Fourier analysis, and further numerical computation techniques in physics. Applications to physical systems and various practical problems solving skills are discussed.  Further MATLAB programming will be introduced and used in this course.",review the theory and principles of mathematical methods and compare the features of various methods;

In the first part, fundamental concepts related to Lagrangian mechanics will be treated. Topics include the variational principle, conservation laws and its relation to Newtonian mechanics. In the second part, we shall discuss applications of the Lagrangian mechanics. Topics include the central force problem, the coupled harmonic oscillators and rigid-body dynamics. Lagrangian mechanics in non-inertial frame will also be discussed.",understand the logical structure of Lagrangian mechanics and its advantage over the Newtonian formulation;; write down the form of Lagrangian for a mechanical system and solve the dynamic equations in simple cases;

The focus is on practical experience in operating telescopes, data acquisition and reduction, and interpretation of the results rather than verification of known astronomical theories.  It is one of the core electives for astronomy minor and an elective course for the astrophysics and experimental physics themes. Upon completion, interested students may apply the techniques learnt here in observational astronomy related capstone courses.","This course will cover the following topics: basics working principles of optical telescopes and CCDs; setting up and hands-on operations of small optical telescopes; error analysis and basic statistics related to the astronomy laboratories; introduction to the magnitude system and celestial coordinates, the color magnitude diagram; observations and data reduction techniques in multi-wavelength astronomy; introduction to data analysis software packages.","acquire astronomy observation techniques; conduct observations to verify the physical principle(s) in astronomy; apply analytical methods required to interpret and analyze results, and draw conclusions from the data; use of effective written and verbal communication skills through written laboratory reports and oral presentation","Pass in (PHYS2265 or PHYS2650);

design and conduct experiments to verify the physics principle(s) commonly used in advanced university-level physics courses; apply analytical methods required to interpret and analyze results, and draw conclusions from the data;

For experimental projects, students have to understand the design of the experiment, carrying it out and analyze the sources of errors.","review the knowledge of a physics or astronomy problem in depth through literature review of books and research journals based on what they have learnt in their majors; criticize existing approaches for solving the selected physics or astronomy problem; describe and explain connections between the physical principles and the study problem; (for theoretical or computational projects) identify the key issues of the problem and solve them independently either by analytical or numerical means, and compare the results with predictions or existing solutions; (for experimental projects) propose and execute physics experiments or astronomical observations, analyze results and sources of errors of the experiment or observation in comparison with predictions; (for projects involving team work) collaborate and communicate effectively in the team, which may comprise of people of different culture, gender and nationality","Pass in at least 24 credits of advanced level (3XXX level or above) disciplinary core/elective courses of the Physics Major, Physics (Intensive) Major, Mathematics/Physics Major or Astronomy Major curriculum.;

The available projects are close to postgraduate level research in physics and/or astronomy.  Passing a pre-approved project is recognized as having completed an elective in one of the four themes.","Students interested in taking this course should contact their prospective supervisors in May to determine the contents and the nature of their projects in the coming academic year.  They must get the approval from both the prospective supervisor and the course coordinator to take this course.For theoretical and numerical projects: Students will receive training in research literature reading and reviewing, and make investigation which is close to research work in nature, under the supervision of a staff member.  The student may need to perform some original calculations, to fill in mathematical gaps of some sophisticated derivations, or a combination of both.  For numerical projects, students also need to use computers to find numerical or simulation results.For experimental projects: Students will carry out experiments in research labs under the supervision of a staff member.  The student will receive a comprehensive training in advanced experimental techniques, including preparation of samples, determination of physical properties, measurement of small signals obscured by noise, laser, high-vacuum and low-temperature techniques and so on.  Wide reading of the relevant scientific literature and originality in experimental design are expected.","plan and execute a theoretical, numerical or experimental research project on a topic in physics or astronomy; review the knowledge of a physics or astronomy problem in depth through literature review of books and research journals based on what they have learnt in their majors; criticize existing approaches for solving the selected physics or astronomy problem; describe and explain connections between the physical principles and the study problem; (for theoretical or computational projects) identify the key issues of the problem and solve them independently either by analytical or numerical means, and compare the results with predictions or existing solutions; (for experimental projects) propose and execute physics experiments or astronomical observations, analyze results and sources of errors of the experiment or observation in comparison with predictions; (for projects involving team work) collaborate and communicate effectively in the team, which may comprise of people of different culture, gender and nationality","Pass in at least 24 credits of advanced level (3XXX level or above) disciplinary core/elective courses of the Physics Major, Physics (Intensive) Major, Mathematics/Physics Major or Astronomy Major curriculum.;

intervals for regression parameters, prediction.(2) Multiple linear regression: least squares method, analysis of variance, coefficient of determination, reduced vs full models, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for regression parameters, prediction, polynomial regression.(3) One-way classification models: one-way ANOVA, analysis of treatment effects, contrasts.(4) Two-way classification models: interactions, two-way ANOVA for balanced data structures, analysis of treatment effects, contrasts, randomised complete block design.(5) Universal approach to linear modelling: dummy variables, 'multiple linear regression' representation of one-way and two-way (unbalanced) models, ANCOVA models, concomitant variables.(6) Regression diagnostics: leverage, residual plot, normal probability plot, outlier, studentized residual, influential observation, Cook's distance, multicollinearity, model transformation.",understand linear regression model with one or multiple independent

The two basic types of derivatives are forwards (having a linear payoff) and options (having a non-linear payoff). All other derivatives can be decomposed to these underlying payoffs or alternatively they are variations on these basic ideas. This course aims at demonstrating the practical use of financial derivatives in risk management.  Emphases are on pricing and hedging strategies, and the no-arbitrage principle.","Review of futures, forwards and options and the no-arbitrage principle; hedging strategies using futures; pricing of forwards and futures; interest rate futures and swaps; trading strategies using options; put-call parity; valuation of European and American options using the binomial-tree model; valuation of European and American options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model; the Greeks: their calculation and interpretation; implied volatility; delta hedging and the role of market-makers; exotic options: Asian options, barrier options, compound options, gap options and exchange options.","use futures, forwards, options and swaps to formulate financial strategies; determine the payoff and the value of various derivative products using binomial tree and Black-Scholes formula; explain how derivative products can be used as tools to manage financial risk; recognize how to decompose complicated derivatives into a portfolio of standard derivatives","Pass in STAT3615; and; Not for students who have passed or already enrolled in any of the following courses: FINA2322, STAT3905, STAT3910; and; Not for BSc(Actuarial Science) students.",2022 Major in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2022 Minor in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Major in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2021 Minor in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Major in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2020 Minor in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Major in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2019 Minor in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Major in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ); 2018 Minor in Risk Management                              (                                                            Disciplinary Elective                                                        ),"2022 Major in Risk Management < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2021 Major in Risk Management < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2020 Major in Risk Management < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2019 Major in Risk Management < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2018 Major in Risk Management < PLO 1,2,3,4,5 >","Y                              2nd sem",Y,A+ to F,"A    Demonstrate thorough mastery at an advanced level of extensive knowledge and skills required for attaining all the course learning outcomes.

parametric survival models; concepts of censoring and/or truncation; parametric estimation of the survival distribution by maximum likelihood estimation method; nonparametric estimation of the survival functions from possibly censored samples by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the Nelson-Aalen estimator; and the kernel density estimator or the Ramlau-Hansen estimator and comparisons of k independent survival functions by means of the generalized log-rank test; parametric regression models; Cox's semiparametric proportional hazards regression model; and multivariate survival analysis.","acquire a clear understanding of the nature of failure time data or survival data, a generalization of the concept of death and life; perform estimation for some commonly used survival

It is related to the possibility of loss arising from defaults on debts, swaps, or other counterparty instruments.  Credit risk may also result from a change in the value of an asset resulting from a change in the counterparty's creditworthiness.  This course will introduce students to quantitative models for measuring and managing credit risk. It also aims to provide students with an understanding of the credit risk methodology used in the financial industry and the regulatory framework in which the credit risk models operate.","Probabilities of default, recovery rates and loss given default; Default and credit migration; credit scoring and internal rating models; Credit portfolio models such as CreditMetrics, CreditPortfolioView, KMV and actuarial approach; Credit derivatives.",understand the Basel requirements for credit risk; estimate credit scores using the logit model; understand and estimate default probabilities using various approaches such as Moody's KMV and the mortality method; understand the concept of credit Value-at-Risk and the CreditMetrics approach;
