4,When do I have to declare my Major?,"You are not required to declare your Major in the first year. You may ""shop around"" in your first and second years and make the decision after your second year of study at the latest."
5,Can I declare a Major in a subject in which I have no background in my secondary school studies?,"Yes, but you may have to study the preparatory courses first to decide whether you can follow the Major."
6,Is there any quota for each Science Major?,No.  Students are free to choose any science Major after admission.
7,"If there is no quota, would there be possibilities that some Majors have a large number of students, some not?","Yes, certainly. But first of all, the Faculty did some estimation and believes the number of students in each Major will not fluctuate too widely from that of the past. Secondly, it is also natural for the number of students in different Majors to go up and down according to demand. Thirdly, the market will have a natural mechanism of adjustment."
8,"If that situation arises, would that degrade the quality of the teaching?",Absolutely not. The Faculty will adjust teaching staff number to cope with changing number of students in a Major.
9,Do I need to spend extra time if I change Major?,"No, if you can still meet the curriculum requirements within the years of studies. If not, you may have to spend an extra semester or a year, or even longer."
10,Can I do double major or take Major-Minor in Science or non-Science discipline?,"Yes, in addition to the primary science Major for the BSc degree, you may take a second Major or a Minor in both Science and non-Science (arts, business, social sciences, engineering, etc) disciplines.  About 1/4 of BSc students take one Major and one Minor, and another 1/4 take two Majors."
11,Do I have one degree or two if I do a second Major in a non-Science discipline? Is it still going to be a BSc one?,"You have only one degree — the BSc, as you are accepted to the Bachelor of Science degree when you are admitted.  The degree always goes with the first Major. But your Majors will be recorded on your transcript."
12,What happens if I want to do specific double Major but there are time-table clashes?,You have to have a primary Major in Science. The feasibility of the second Major or Minor does depend on timetable. The Faculty cannot make guarantee on feasibility of all combinations.
13,Is there any quota for a second Major or Minor in other Faculties?,"There is no quota for Science Majors, but for the Majors and Minors offered by other faculties, enrolment of courses may be restricted by quota, timetable clashes or certain requirements. There may be circumstances that you are not able to enroll in some of the popular courses offered by non-science departments, such as business courses."
14,Can I take advanced level courses in Year 1?,"Yes, subject to the approval of the department that offers the courses."
15,"If I do the Major-Minor instead of a single Major, will I be less employable by a specialty field? Will the chance of furthering my study in a specialised subject be degraded?","For those who intend to develop a career in a specialised area or further their study (MPhil/PhD), we would recommend them to specialise early on one subject and takes more than the minimum number of core courses required for the specialised subject."
16,How do companies know how specialised I am in a subject?,The courses you have taken and the Major/Minor will be shown on the transcript.
17,How do I get advice from the Faculty on course selection?,"We understand that selection of Major or course is a very important decision for students.
