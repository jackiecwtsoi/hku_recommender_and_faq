0,How do I apply to HKU through JUPAS scheme?,We welcome your application to HKU through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) if you are a LOCAL applicant applying on the strength of Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). Please check the JUPAS website via https://www.jupas.edu.hk/en/ for eligibility and procedures of JUPAS application.,HKDSE
1,What are the common mistakes as a JUPAS applicant?,"Students should not forget that in addition to the overall result, they must meet the minimum University Entrance Requirements (UER) and the additional entryance requirements for individual programmes. For details, please refer to https://www.hku.hk/dse. It should be noted that instead of the actual priority of programme choices, the preferences of applicants are only made known to the institutions in the form of 5 bands (i.e. Band A, B, C, D, E). As long as students meet the admissions requirements of the programmes, they may have the opportunity to be admitted to more than one programmes at the same time. After institutions submit the merit order list results to the JUPAS Office, students will be assigned to the highest-ranked programme according to their priority. Therefore, to avoid missing the chance of being assigned to their preferred programmes, students should not neglect their personal interests when indicating programmes as their Band A choices. Students do not check emails regularly, and incorrectly fill in the contact information in the ""JUPAS"" account (such as incorrect or infrequently used email account, contact number and address). This hinders us from effectively notifying students about interview arrangements or other important messages. As we will distribute information mainly via email and/or SMS, students should ensure that they fill in the correct, complete and commonly used contact methods, and check emails regularly to avoid missing important information.",HKDSE
2,How can I apply to HKU as a HKDSE repeater?,All students who apply to HKU on the basis of HKDSE results must only make their application through JUPAS. Please also refer to the JUPAS website via https://www.jupas.edu.hk/en/ for eligibility and procedures of JUPAS application.,HKDSE

7,"If I am a non-Chinese speaking (NCS) student, can I apply to HKU with other qualifications in Chinese language apart from the HKDSE result?","We welcome eligible NCS applicants (both school and non-school) to submit Alternative Qualifications in Chinese Language (ACL), i.e. GCSE / GCE etc. for consideration in lieu of the general Chinese language requirement. If NCS applicants submit more than one ACL and / or have HKDSE Chinese Language result during selection, the best result will be considered. Further information on submissions and verification of ACL is available at the JUPAS website.",HKDSE
8,"Can I use other public examination results such as IB, GCE and IGCSE to fulfill the JUPAS admission requirement?","For JUPAS admission scheme, the University will only consider the HKDSE result of an applicant.

69,"What are the differences between our BASc programme and other programmes within the BASc family (i.e. BASc in Fintech, AI, Design+ or GHD)?","While other BASc programmes require students to take a series of fixed courses, our BASc programme is more flexible and open-ended. This BASc programme gives you the flexibility to choose what to study across the Arts, Science and Social Sciences faculties to fulfil the core Major in Interdisciplinary Studies. This means you have the freedom to create your own degree based on your passions and ambitions. You will also have 96 credits to use on free electives or to declare another major or minor.",BASc
70,What are majors and minors and what is the difference between them?,"When we say we “declare a major” in a certain discipline or field (available from completing year 1), it means that we are committed to focus our studies on that subject. A major in HKU usually implies taking 12 to 16 courses (72-96 credits) and it is often considered comparable to someone who has completed a specific degree in that field. A minor, in contrast, requires less commitment; it usually means taking 6-8 courses (36-48 credits) only. This would give them more room to declare a double minor or take other free elective courses in other subjects that interest them.",BASc
71,What can I choose for my second major/minors?,"This list is too long to be listed here! You can choose from majors/minors in diverse subjects such as Computer Science, Fine Arts, Business Design and Innovation, Psychology, Food and Nutritional Sciences and many many more. In 2020, there will be 70 majors and 84 minors available for you to choose from, and the number is still expanding. For a full list of major and minor choices see here: http://aao.hku.hk/sy3/plan-of-study/major-and-minor/",BASc
72,What are the differences between BASc and Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Social Sciences / Bachelor of Science?,"The BASc programme is jointly offered by the three faculties as our programme gives students the unprecedented opportunity to take courses across the three faculties. Unlike the other, faculty-specific programmes such as BSocSc, BA or BSc, we do not require students to take a particular number of credits or to declare a major within a specific faculty; our students have great flexibility in choosing what they want to study than students in these other programmes. Besides this flexibility, the BASc programme also includes some additional, unique, courses that will train each student to become a world leader. We also offer tailor-made internship experiences that are not typically offered to students on other programmes. Each student will also have personal mentorship with the BASc programme director, who will help them plan for their degree and their future thereafter. Finally, students on our programme will also be able to benefit from a close connection with other BASc family students on other BASc programmes so that they will be able to develop a network of friends from diverse disciplines. You may refer to this page that illustrate the special features of this unique programme in Hong Kong.",BASc
73,"I studied science subjects in high school, and I did not do any arts/ social sciences subjects. Would it be difficult for me to catch up or be disadvantaged in application?","This is a common concern among many students. However, as most university subjects are not offered in secondary school and the majority of students also have little exposure to the subjects they come across, the university curriculum is designed to allow students to start from introductory courses and advance further. In our BASc programme, each student can have access to their mentor and receive personal advice on designing the curriculum path that best fits them, which most current students appreciate.",BASc
74,Do I need to study any particular subject in order to get into BASc?,"There is no particular subject requirement other than those set by the university. However, HKDSE applicants should achieve level 5 or above in English. That said, we do give preference to those placing this programme as their first choice (non-JUPAS applicants) or in Band A (JUPAS applicants).",BASc
75,What is the admission score of the previous intake year?,Please refer to here for the latest information: https://admissions.hku.hk/sites/default/files/2022-03/HKU%20JUPAS%20Admissions%202022_formula%20and%20scores.pdf,BASc
76,Can I participate in the exchange programme offered by the University/ Faculty of Social Sciences?,"Though it is not a compulsory graduation requirement in our programme, you are strongly recommended to join one!",BASc
77,What are the exchange opportunities available to this programme?,"For our BASc programme, there are broadly 3 exchange programmes available to each student. Besides the popular HKU Worldwide Undergraduate Student Exchange Programme (HKUWW) and the more prestigious HKUWW Plus that includes University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Yale University, amongst others, students in the BASc programme can also participate in different exchange programmes organised by the Faculty of Social Sciences. This innovative arrangement allows you to study overseas for various lengths of time in different top-tier universities! HKU also offers financial subsidies to students who need some extra support whilst they are on their exchange. In the BASc programme, we encourage our students to become global citizens who are exposed to ideas and solutions from across the world, not just here in Hong Kong.",BASc
78,Will there be any fewer opportunities compared to other traditional programmes?,"At HKU, applicants will be competing with all other students within the University/Faculty based on their GPA and interview performance etc., the programme you study generally does not affect this consideration unless the host institution has an explicit preference (say, business school preferring business major students). However, you can also make yourself eligible for these experiences through picking an appropriate second major. So, there is no disadvantage when compared to other traditional programme. In fact, you will benefit from our small class size as we can give you more advice on exchange opportunities.",BASc
79,"I understand that this degree opens me up to many job opportunities as I can choose what to focus on, but will it be difficult to find a job with this general programme?","What ""qualifies you"" for the job you want often has little to do with your degree/major (though it is the entrance ticket for some professions). In recent years, employers are placing more emphasis on one’s interpersonal and communication skills, critical thinking ability as well as adaptivity to deal with novel situations. This is also why universities throughout the world are shifting away from offering fixed curriculums, which usually tend to focus on ‘hard skills’, to becoming more open-ended in their programme structure in a way that incorporates more teamwork and problem-solving opportunities (soft skills). If you have checked with the job advertisements, most multinational and large companies have no requirements on applicants’ disciplinary background in the most thriving positions; some even implicitly exclude applicants trained in specialised programmes as often they can only see things from a narrow point of view. Our BASc degree would allow you to choose the field you want to study while equipping you with ability to handle complex tasks that we will face in the 21st Century.",BASc
80,What advisers are there at the University to help me with studies?,"There are six types of Academic Advisers under the University-wide Academic Advising System who can help you with studies:
1. Faculty Academic Advisers (FAA – teachers at your home Faculty);
2. Faculty Temporary Academic Adviser (TAA – teachers who specialize on helping students to explore major/minor options);
3. Faculty Student Advisers;
4. Residential Student Advisers;

99,How many courses can I take for the summer semester? Do I need to pay for that?,"Under normal circumstances, you can take 2 courses at most for the summer semester. Fee exemption/reduction usually applies for HKU students. For details, please check with the course offering departments.",AAO
100,Can I late drop a course?,"Late drop is usually not allowed after the add/drop period. Also, the decision to late drop a course might have far-reaching ramifications, such as jeopardizing your progress of studies and you might not meet the minimum requirement of 24 credits after dropping the course.",AAO
101,Can I late add a course?,Late add is usually not recommended after the add/drop period unless you have a very strong reason for that. Please seek approval from your Faculty on this if needed.,AAO
102,How are full-year courses counted towards my study load?,"Half of the credits of full-year courses are counted towards the study load for each semester, that is, 6 credits in the first semester and 6 credits in the second semester for a 12-credit full-year course. Under normal circumstances, the final grades of full-year courses will only be counted in the GPA for the second semester after you have completed the full-year courses.",AAO
103,"If I have completed more than 60 credits in an academic year, can I take fewer in the subsequent year(s) of study as long as I can complete a total of 240 credits upon graduation?","Yes, you can.

105,What should I do if I have not met the prerequisite(s) for a course I wish to take?,"Please note that almost all courses are very strict on the fulfillment of relevant prerequisite requirements, if any. Please check with the Faculty/course-offering department concerned if you need help on this. Wavier is almost impossible unless you have a very strong justification for that.",AAO
106,Are there any regulations on the number of introductory courses and advanced courses that I need to take?,It depends. Some programmes do have a ceiling on the total number of credits of introductory courses that a student can take. You might need to “make up” the excess credits of introductory courses by taking the same number of credits of advanced courses. Please be reminded that level 2 courses are not necessarily advanced level courses. It is very important for you to check with your home Faculty on this if in doubt.,AAO
107,Can I take an advanced course in my first year of study?,"Yes, provided that you have fulfilled the relevant pre-requisite requirement(s).",AAO
108,What should I consider when considering majors / minors?,"First, reflect on your interests, strengths and goals and see what major / minor options are available in the University, then try to find out more about each particular subject of interest before you make your choices.

109,Whom should I seek advice from for my major / minor selection?,"You can seek advice from your Faculty Academic Adviser and the advisers at the Academic Advising Office. You can also request a Temporary Academic Adviser (TAA) in SIS. TAAs are current teachers from specific programmes who specialize on helping students explore major/minor options and attend to questions for a particular subject area. Also, you can try to talk to some senior students who are from your interested majors/minors. If you are concerned about employment prospect of your interested major, you may talk to Careers Advisers at CEDARS (Career and Placement) to understand employers’ expectations and how to make career preparation.",AAO
110,When should I declare major/minor?,"For most non-professional programmes, the earliest students can declare major is before the start of their second year. By the start of the third year of studies, students are required to declare their majors/minors. Before deciding on your major, you have to think about your academic interests and career aspirations. It is also very important for you to consider which prerequisite courses to take in your first year in order to declare the major(s)/minor(s) you like.",AAO
111,Are there any academic requirements for declaring a specific major/minor?,"It depends. Faculties may have requirements, for example, attainment of a certain level in certain HKDSE subjects or a pre-requisite introductory course for specific majors/ minors.

114,Can I change my major/ minor later? How many times can I change it?,"It depends on the setup which may vary from programme to programme. Under normal circumstances and for most Faculties, if you are in a non-professional programme, after you declare your major/minor, you can still revise/change your choices in the subsequent course selection/ add drop periods (no regulations on the number of times you can make changes) until the first semester of your final year. No changes are allowed to be made in the second semester of the final year. Please consult your home Faculties for assistance if in doubt.",AAO
115,How will my study plan be affected if I switch my majors/ minors?,You can use the “What if” system in Degree Audit in SIS to check study loads if you choose different major/ minor combinations. (Navigation: HKU Portal -> My Page -> SIS Menu -> Academic Records -> My Degree Audit),AAO
116,"Can I take a first-year prerequisite course for a major/minor, in my second/third year of study?","For most majors/ minors, you can. Please check with the Faculty if in doubt.",AAO
117,"If I have declared a second major or a minor, but I cannot go on to complete them. What are the consequences?","If you cannot complete the second major or the minor at the end, these second majors/ minors would not be shown on your transcript. The courses that you have done towards these majors/ minors will be counted as free electives. In all cases, please double check with your Faculty Office if in doubt.",AAO
118,Would all the credits that I took for a particular major be ‘totally wasted’ if I switch to a new one? Do I need to start from scratch again?,"A major usually requires 72-96 credits. If you switch major, it is very likely that you have to start with the introductory courses in the “new” major again. Therefore, you should consider carefully whether you can finish your degree on time if you switch. Usually, the credits that you have already earned can be counted as electives. In all cases, please double check with your Faculty Office.",AAO
119,Different majors/minors may have overlapping courses for their respective programmes. Can I use the same course taken to fulfill the requirements of more than one major or minor? What should I do if I can’t?,Double-counting of courses for fulfilling more than one major or minor is not allowed. You are advised to consult the programmes concerned and see which replacement course(s) you are required to study so that the total credits completed for each major or minor will not be reduced. You may also refer to the Degree Audit report on SIS for your progress with each declared major/minor.,AAO
120,How do I know if I have fulfilled all the requirements of a major/minor?,It is your responsibility to check the course enrollment on a regular basis to ensure whether you have complied with the relevant curriculum requirements of the majors/ minors you have chosen. You may also refer to the Degree Audit report on SIS for your progress with each declared major/minor.,AAO
121,Will my degree certificate show my major(s)/minor(s)?,"Your completed major(s)/minor(s) will only be shown on your academic transcript and the academic attainment profile, but not on the degree certificate.",AAO
122,"Can I extend my period of study to fulfill the requirement of an additional major/minor, even if I have already taken the required 240 credits?","Under normal circumstances, no. Since a second major and/or minors are only optional parts of your studies and not graduation requirements, you will not be permitted to extend the period of study to fulfill such requirements if you have already completed the graduation requirements.",AAO
123,Should I select courses for the first semester or both semesters in August each year?,"During semester 1, students should enroll on courses offered in both semester 1 and 2. However, students are advised to enroll on courses offered in semester 1 first, and then semester 2; During semester 2, students should enroll on courses offered in both semester 2 and summer semester. However, students are advised to enroll on courses offered in semester 2 first, then summer semester. In general, final year students cannot enroll on summer courses in the summer semester.",AAO
124,Who will consider my course enrolment and when will I know if my course selection is approved/disapproved?,It depends on the course approval nature which will be shown when students are adding a class. Students will also receive emails generated by the System notifying the status of their course enrollment. Students can also check their enrollment status under their SIS menu -> Enrollment -> Enrollment Status.,AAO
125,"When the course selection status reads “pending”, what does it mean? When will I know the results?",It means it is still pending for approval or pending for consideration by offering Faculty/Department. The results will vary from course to course and it depends very much on the course approval nature defined for each course.,AAO
126,Where can I check the approval status of the courses I have selected?,Under their SIS menu -> Enrollment -> Enrollment Status,AAO
127,I cannot enroll on a course successfully because of an error “Class has been closed”. Will the class be opened again?,It depends on whether there is any student who drops the class. Class will be opened again when there are students dropping the class.,AAO
128,"I have enrolled on a course, but it has been dropped by the System automatically. What happened? What should I do?",It depends on the course approval nature and especially when the student is not approved or has violated the regulations/requirements. The System may drop the class for the student and notify them via email so that they can enroll on other courses/classes as soon as possible.,AAO
129,I dropped my course by mistake. What should I do …?,"Students can re-enroll on the same class if it is still open (class will be closed if it is already full). If students cannot re-enroll on the same class when the class is still open, they can try login with another browser and enroll again.",AAO
130,Can I change my course selection in SIS after the add/drop period?,"Students are not allowed to change their course selection after the Add/Drop period.

For some majors which require applications, students should follow the instructions outlined in the Faculty/Department website.",AAO
132,How can I change my major/minor in SIS?,The steps are similar to those for declaring major/ minor. Please refer to “Student’s Quick Reference Guide on Major / Minor Declaration” in the SIS website for Students.,AAO
133,"After I declare a particular major/minor, will I be given priority to enroll on their required courses (such as the pre-requisite / introductory courses)?","There are different course approval natures which vary from course to course. Some of the courses adopt first-come-first-served, some of them adopt random balloting by system and some of them adopt manual balloting. So it is very much depended on the course approval nature defined for each individual course. Some of the courses have set up pre-requisite requirements which has nothing to do with priority. Once pre-requisite is set up in a course, it checks to see if students have met the pre-requisite requirements before allowing them to enroll to that course. If you have not met the pre-requisite requirements of the course(s), you could not enroll into them and an error message will pop up to inform you that course enrolment is unsuccessful due to unfulfillment of the pre-requisite requirements.",AAO
134,"If I cannot complete the requirements of my declared second major/minor at the end, will SIS automatically count those courses as my free electives?","If students have declared a second major or minor and they cannot fulfill those requirements, the courses done towards these programmes will be counted as free electives. However, for the degree audit report, these courses will not be treated as free electives automatically. You need to drop your second major or minor so that those courses can fall into the free electives section of the degree audit report.",AAO
135,"If I have fulfilled the requirements (i.e., successfully completed all required courses) of a particular major/minor, but have not declared it at SIS, will SIS automatically “declare” it for me?","In general, for programmes requiring a major for graduation, Faculties will define three periods for major/minor declaration and they are (i) allow to declare from; (ii) must declare by: and (iii) last term to access; These three periods vary from programme to programme but in general, students are allowed to declare a major starting from semester 1 of their second year of study. And they must declare their major by the first semester of their third year of study if they have not declared any major in their second year of study.
SIS will NOT declare the major/minor for students automatically.",AAO
136,"Is there a limit on the number of major/minor that I can declare in SIS? For example, can I declare 3 minors?","Please refer to the University Regulations for details of different major/ minor requirements. As for SIS, it is currently designed to allow students to declare a maximum of 2 majors and 2 minors online and checking of overloading is also in place during course selection period. You are advised to observe the University regulations for not exceeding the maximum curriculum study load. You may also seek advice from your home Faculties and seek assistance from them for individual concerns.",AAO

You have to write at your earliest opportunity to the Examinations Office which will seek the recommendations from the Chief Examiner(s) concerned on your request. Approval MUST be sought before the original date of the exam.,AAO
141,What should I do if I fail a course?,"In general, you have to take course(s) to make up for the failed/outstanding credits immediately in the following semester, by either repeating the same course or taking another course with the required credits. For detailed arrangement, please consult your Faculty Office. In case you need to take more than 36 credits in a semester to make up the failed/outstanding credits, i.e. exceed the maximum semester study load as stipulated under the Regulations, you will have to seek approval from your Faculty for overloading first.",AAO
142,Can I appeal for my exam results?,"There are no appeals against the results of exams and all other forms of assessment. You may however request checking of assessment results on grounds of procedural irregularities. The application fee is HK$200 for each assessment result to be checked. For further information, please see the Procedures for Checking of Assessment Results of Taught Courses.",AAO

For those subjects with “restricted access”, students need to contact the lecturer direct.",AAO
145,Could I retake a course if the grade of my first attempt is not good?,"No, as long as you have passed the course, even if you are not happy with the grade, you could not retake it.",AAO
146,How are failed credits counted in my academic record?,"All courses attempted will be recorded on the transcript, including failed courses. If you choose to repeat the failed course, the new grade obtained will be recorded in the semester in which you have retaken the course but the failed grades will still be included in the calculation of the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA), Year GPA (YGPA), Cumulative GPA (CGPA), and Graduation GPA (GGPA). All failed grades will be taken into account when determining your honours classification.",AAO
147,Will there be different weighting of courses taken in the calculation of my honours classification?,"No. All courses carry equal weighting, regardless of the year in which they are offered and whether they are in the students’ major(s) in the calculation of honours classification.",AAO
148,How will my honours classification be determined upon my graduation?,"The classification of honours shall be determined by the Board of Examiners in accordance with the following Cumulative GPA (CGPA) scores, with all courses taken (including failed courses) carrying equal weighting:",AAO
149,Will the selection of the Pass/ Fail grading for courses affect my honours classification?,"To award honours to you, the University normally employs a ‘50% rule’, which mandates that at least half of the credits of your degree curriculum should be letter-graded. This means, if your programme requires 240 credits for graduation, you will normally be required to have at least 120 letter-graded credits in order to be awarded a honour. A student with fewer than half the total credits letter-graded will normally be awarded a pass degree with no honours classification. Therefore, we suggest you to think extremely carefully before opting for pass/fail grading, especially if you are in special situations such as senior-year entry or granted advanced standing. For further enquiries, please clarify with your Faculty. ",AAO
150,"What are the differences between SGPA, YGPA, CGPA and GGPA?",GPA is the abbreviation of Grade Point Average. Different calculations of GPA are listed as follows:,AAO

152,Will I be discontinued from studies if I have failed the same course for 3 times?,"It depends. Some (not all) curriculums stipulate that the maximum number of attempts for a particular course or requirement is three. As such, students pursuing these curriculums might need to sit for the FRC/ COD if they have failed the same course for three times and might be at the risk of being discontinued from studies.",AAO
153,Which units I should seek help from if my academic result in the first semester is not good or if I need to sit for the FRC or CoD?,"If you have any study problems, you can always seek help from your Faculty Academic Advisers or from us, the advisers at the Academic Advising Office. You can make an appointment with us here.",AAO
154,When should I start planning for exchange?,"There are two main options for exchange: HKU Worldwide Undergraduate Student Exchange Programme (HKUWW) and the Faulty-level exchange programme. No matter which option you wish to go for, we usually suggest students to plan for exchange at least a year ahead. For example, if you are interested in going on exchange in year three, you should  plan for it in the beginning of year two. Please visit the website of the International Affairs Office (https://intlaffairs.hku.hk/) or your own Faculty for more details.",AAO
155,Do I need to extend my study period if I go on exchange?,"It depends on whether your host institution offers subjects in your major programme at HKU and whether you are able to transfer back enough number of credits to satisfy the requirements of your programme. AAO has a 3-min briefing on exchange planning. If you have further questions, consult IAO and your Faculty Office.",AAO
156,Do I get credits for the courses I completed during exchange?,"Yes. If you wish to transfer credits, you must apply for credit transfer in advance according to your Faculty’s regulations and requirement.

157,"If I go on exchange studies in the second semester but I have to take a full-year course in that academic year to fulfil the requirement(s) of a major/minor, what should I do?","Since enrollment record of all courses (including any full-year courses) during the exchange period will be deleted, it is very important for you to consult your Faculty on how you could complete the outstanding requirements of your full-year course before you set off for exchange. ",AAO
158,What are the application procedures and the documents required for credit transfer from exchange studies?,"Before going on exchange, you have to consult the relevant Faculty/School(s)/Department(s) at HKU on which courses you can take in your host institution in order to transfer credits when you return. You are required to submit your application for credit transfer approval prior to your exchange trip. Different Faculties might adopt different procedures on this so please check this out. As for required documents, different Faculties might have different guidelines, but in general, supporting documents related to the dates of exchange semesters, study load and proposed courses for credit transfer should be submitted, such as course syllabuses and course outlines (with credit information and assessment methods, etc.). Please contact your Faculty for details.",AAO

172,When and how do I apply for leave of absence?,"You need to apply for leave of absence if you are unable to attend classes (lectures, tutorials, or any other scheduled teaching) due to exchange studies, medical or personal reasons. For instance, if you go on exchange studies, you have to apply for leave of absence for the semester(s) during which you will be away from HKU. You have to complete the form “Application for Leave of Absence” and submit it to the Faculty Office at the earliest opportunity, in any case BEFORE the commencement of the leave period. In the application, you have to explain clearly the reason(s) for taking leave (either for exchange studies, medical or personal reasons) and attach the relevant supporting document(s). Applications for leave retrospectively are normally not accepted.",AAO
173,What is plagiarism and what happens if I am found to have committed plagiarism?,"To put it simply, plagiarism is defined as the unacknowledged use, as one’s own, of work of another person, whether or not such work has been published. It also includes self-plagiarism, that is, the unacknowledged use of your own previous work(s), for example, your works/ papers for other courses. Any student who commits plagiarism is liable to disciplinary action which can result in very serious consequences – including expulsion from the University. Therefore, you are strongly advised to visit the website “What is Plagiarism” (https://tl.hku.hk/plagiarism/) so to learn thoroughly what plagiarism is, its consequences, how to avoid it, the learning resources and the relevant policies and regulations. More importantly, don’t hesitate to consult your teachers if you have any questions about how to avoid plagiarism.",AAO
