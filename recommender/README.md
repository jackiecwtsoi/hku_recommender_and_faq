# Recommender System
Inside this recommender system, we provide recommendations to student users of three major types:
1. Career
2. University subject/major domain (subjects from HKU Faculty of Science and Computer Science only)
3. Specific HKU courses (HKU Faculty of Science and Computer Science only)

## Supported Models
We have already pretrained some models for various parts of our recommender. Follow the step below for the program code to run successfully:
- Download and unzip the 'models' folder from [this link](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tsoic1_connect_hku_hk/EuDe6EoslUZPpeVBerNktb0BP_5Hden719xZ8-eYN8c4BA?e=kIU614) and move this 'models' to inside the current directory ('recommender')
