This program will explore the mechanisms by which coastal communities in the US and SE Asia are facing these expanding challenges, including their impacts on coastal ecosystems. Using a comparative approach, students will explore the diverse challenges facing coastal societies, and will gain an in-depth understanding of coupled human-natural systems on the coasts of New England and Southeast Asia (Hong Kong and Malaysia).By comparing and contrasting both ecosystems and societies, students will develop an appreciation for both the commonalities of challenges facing the world's coasts, as well as differences that occur due to local ecology. A major emphasis of the program will be on solutions, and how by taking a global perspective we can accelerate methods for climate change adaptation that span traditional cultural barriers. We will blend studies of threats facing both human and natural systems in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Gulf of Maine with an in-depth exploration of how those societies have (or have not) enacted solutions to those challenges. - Understand the primary drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem function in rocky intertidal, mangrove and coral reef ecosystems in USA and SE Asia.-  Gain an appreciation for how urban ecosystems in this region are being affected by climate change, development and stress from pollution- Better understand how history and governance structures of Hong Kong, Malaysia and New England constrain and/or facilitate coastal adaptation strategies- Appreciate how cultural practices such as seafood preferences and traditional medicine affect harvesting of marine species, and how this impacts coastal biodiversity","Articulating similarities and differences between how coupled human-natural systems operate in SE Asia and in comparable habitats in the U.S.A.; Reading and synthesizing review articles in the primary literature in marine science and social science literature, and explain the connections among these diverse approaches; Articulating arguments about how traditional Chinese, Malaysian and American culture affect human impacts on the environment, and to develop potential solutions to these issues based on conversations with peers; Becoming comfortable collaborating with peers from U.S.A, and gain a greater understanding of the culture of the region",0.49618709087371826,0.5236927270889282,0.26370134949684143,0.48119020760059356
