# ontology-based-personalized-course-recommender-system

This is one of the three major parts of the DASC7600 Data Science Project course of the HKU MDASC programme. We develop a personalized HKU information recommender and Q&A system based on the established OPCR framework, which is a core part of the HKU metaverse chatbot's functionality.

There are two parts to this system:
1. [University and career related information recommender](recommender/)
2. [HKU FAQ/Q&A system](faq/)
