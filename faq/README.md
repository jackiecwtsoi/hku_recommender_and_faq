# FAQ/Q&A System
Inside this FAQ/Q&A system, we have two major components and provide query answers based on scores generated from both components:
1. [Query-Question similarity](q-Q_similarity)
2. [Query-Answer relevance](q-A_relevance)

## Supported Models
We have already pretrained some models for our q-Q and q-A components. To use them, we need to download and put them in the correct directories:
- Download and unzip the 'models' folder from [this link](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tsoic1_connect_hku_hk/Eg9LQHKZ1pJKkLhImKIp-mYBp1put7IeQgZP_Iye0owyjg?e=eqtSUF) and move it to the [q-Q_similarity](q-Q_similarity) folder in this repo.
- Download and unzip the 'models' folder from [this link](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tsoic1_connect_hku_hk/EudbXkV3__BLm0ih8zBG-80BkOJT5Nd2D-wmryVLnEs7IQ?e=ymALiE) and move it to the [q-A_relevance](q-A_relevance) folder in this repo.
